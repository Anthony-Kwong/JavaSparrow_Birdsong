#second attempt at plots for tempo project

#zipf: When birds sing longer songs (by note number), do they sing shorter versions of the note classes?

# one data point per note class
#y = average note length (across entire pop), x = song duration, col by note class

#menz: are long elements made of smaller bits
# x = mean note length, y = mean frequency across pop, col by note class

#those ones are statistically significant, America and Asian have much smaller p-valuea. Yes but both are sig. and very small. 

#try the new model and it should be clearer
